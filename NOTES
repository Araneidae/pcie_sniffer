FA Sniffer
==========

udev Configuration
------------------

The following line works for udev in `/etc/udev/rules.d/10-local.rules`:

----
SUBSYSTEM=="fa_sniffer", MODE="0444", OPTIONS="last_rule"
----

For some reason we need to set `last_rule`, otherwise this rule doesn't get
applied.

See http://reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html[] for documentation on udev
rules.  Some useful programs noted there:

`udevtest`:: 
Given path to sysfs node ('without' the leading `/sys`) prints the udev rules
that will be applied.  For example:
+
----
udevtest /class/fa_sniffer/fa_sniffer0
----

`udevinfo`::
Walks sysfs tree printing information about the device as understood by udev.
In this case the actual path must be passed.  For example:
+
----
udevinfo -a -p /sys/class/fa_sniffer/fa_sniffer0
----


Device configuration with udev
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The FA archiver tool runs best with direct output to a target block device.  For
this to be successful the device needs to be writeable.  One solution is to
ensure that the FA archiver runs as a member of a group, say `targetdev`, with
the following line in `/etc/udev/rules.d/`:

----
KERNEL=="sdb", GROUP="targetdev", MODE="0660", OPTIONS="last_rule"
----


Installation using dkms
-----------------------

To install on target system, let `$SOURCE` be the directory containing the
fa_sniffer driver, then the following commands should be sufficient for a
complete installation (on RHEL 5):

----
# cp $SOURCE/fa_sniffer.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
# ln -fsn $SOURCE /usr/src/fa_sniffer-1.0
# dkms add -m fa_sniffer -v 1.0
# dkms build -m fa_sniffer -v 1.0
# dkms install -m fa_sniffer -v 1.0
